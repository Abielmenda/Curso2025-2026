  <h1>Dataset Requirements — Group 08</h1>

  <h2>Selected Datasets</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Air Quality in Barcelona</strong> — measurements of air pollutants across monitoring stations in the city.</li>
    <li><strong>Traffic Street Sections with Weather Forecast</strong> — traffic intensity and weather conditions in real time with 15-minute predictions.</li>
    <li><strong>Parking Service for Bikes in Barcelona</strong> — geolocated public bike parking facilities and their capacities.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Evaluation of Requirements</h2>

  <table>
    <tr><th>Requirement</th><th>Description</th><th>Fulfilled</th></tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>R1</strong></td>
      <td>All datasets belong to smart city domains: air quality (environment), traffic (mobility), and bike parking (sustainable transport).</td>
      <td>✅</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>R2</strong></td>
      <td>Each dataset is available in CSV format, downloaded from the Open Data BCN portal.</td>
      <td>✅</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>R3</strong></td>
      <td>All datasets are distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license, allowing reuse and publication.</td>
      <td>✅</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>R4</strong></td>
      <td>Datasets include spatial information (latitude, longitude, district, or street name) and can be linked with DBpedia, Wikidata, or GeoNames resources.</td>
      <td>✅</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>R5</strong></td>
      <td>Documentation is provided for all datasets in the Open Data BCN portal, including field descriptions and update frequency.</td>
      <td>✅ (Optional)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>R6</strong></td>
      <td>The traffic dataset integrates two data sources (traffic + weather), while the others come from single sources.</td>
      <td>✅ (Partially)</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h2>Conclusions</h2>
  <p>
    The selected datasets fulfill all mandatory requirements (R1–R4) and partially satisfy optional ones (R5–R6).  
    Together they cover complementary aspects of urban life — environmental quality, mobility, and infrastructure — forming an ideal foundation for building a smart city application that explores the relationship between traffic, pollution, and sustainable transport.
