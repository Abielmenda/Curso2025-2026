  <h1>Application Requirements — Group 08</h1>

  <h2>Application Title</h2>
  <p><strong>BCN Mobility & Air Explorer</strong></p>

  <h2>Purpose and Objectives</h2>
  <p>
    The aim of this application is to provide citizens and researchers with an integrated view of environmental and mobility data in Barcelona.
    By combining information about air quality, traffic conditions, and bicycle infrastructure, the application helps understand how mobility patterns and weather affect pollution levels and urban sustainability.
  </p>

  <h2>Core Functionalities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Visualize <strong>air quality levels</strong> across monitoring stations on an interactive map.</li>
    <li>Display <strong>current traffic conditions</strong> with real-time weather information and short-term forecasts.</li>
    <li>Show the distribution and capacity of <strong>bike parking facilities</strong> to promote sustainable transport.</li>
    <li>Allow users to filter by district, pollutant type, or traffic status.</li>
    <li>Provide statistical charts comparing pollution and mobility trends.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Target Users</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Citizens interested in environmental and mobility information.</li>
    <li>Urban planners and public administrators.</li>
    <li>Researchers studying the correlation between traffic and air pollution.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Integration and Expected Links</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Air Quality</strong> data linked with pollutant definitions (DBpedia/Wikidata) and geolocations.</li>
    <li><strong>Traffic</strong> sections linked with street entities and weather conditions.</li>
    <li><strong>Bike Parking</strong> facilities linked with nearby districts or points of interest.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>User Interface (Mock-ups)</h2>
  <p>The application will provide three main views:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Map View</strong> — displays traffic and air quality sensors with color-coded icons.</li>
    <li><strong>Statistics View</strong> — interactive charts showing correlations (e.g., PM10 levels vs. traffic intensity).</li>
    <li><strong>Infrastructure View</strong> — shows available bike parking by district.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    <em>(Mock-ups to be added as sketches or screenshots in the final report.)</em>
  </p>

  <h2>Expected Impact</h2>
  <p>
    The application supports data-driven decision-making in urban planning and promotes awareness about the environmental impact of traffic and sustainable mobility options.
