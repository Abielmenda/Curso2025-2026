# Hands-On 2 – Self-Assessment

## Group 12

### 1. Data Analysis
We analyzed the structure of the dataset, identifying pollutants, timestamps, and station coordinates.

### 2. Licensing
We confirmed that the dataset is licensed under CC BY 4.0 from the Madrid Open Data Portal.

### 3. Resource Naming Strategy
We defined a clear and consistent URI strategy for ontology, stations, and measurements.

### 4. Ontology
We developed a lightweight ontology describing stations and pollutant measurements.

### 5. RDF Example
We created an RDF example with one station and one measurement instance.

### 6. Tools Used
- OpenRefine for CSV inspection  
- Protégé for ontology creation  
- Text editor for RDF Turtle syntax

### 7. Teamwork
Work was completed collaboratively and submitted on time.
